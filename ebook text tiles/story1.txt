        The Watch People is a story about a group of people who live in a world where time is currency. In this world,
        fractional reserve banking to create wealth based on debt is impossible. It would fracture the entire universe and result in 
        a time paradox of epic proportions greater than even that in the hit film from 1989, MILLENNIUM, where an NTSB investigator
        discovers a time-traveling woman while investigating an airplane crash. This is real, not AI generated. It's a great film, 
        everyone should see it.
