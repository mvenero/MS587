    <p id="story1" style="display: none;">
        The Watch People is a story about a group of people who live in a world where time is currency. In this world,
        fractional reserve banking to create wealth based on debt is impossible. It would fracture the entire universe and result in 
        a time paradox of epic proportions greater than even that in the hit film from 1989, MILLENNIUM, where an NTSB investigator
        discovers a time-traveling woman while investigating an airplane crash. This is real, not AI generated. It's a great film, 
        everyone should see it.

        In the small town of Willow Creek, something strange was happening. Ants, of all creatures, were seen gathering materials and constructing what appeared to be a railroad, right in the heart of the town. The townspeople were in disbelief as they watched the tiny insects diligently working day and night on their mysterious project.
        The railroad was unlike anything the town had ever seen before. It twisted and turned in intricate patterns, with tracks leading off into the woods and disappearing into the shadows. The townspeople whispered amongst themselves, wondering what could possibly be the purpose of such a bizarre construction.
        Rumors began to spread about the ants and their railroad. Some said that they were building a path to the underworld, while others believed they were trying to escape some unseen danger. The fear and paranoia in Willow Creek grew with each passing day, as the ants continued their work, undeterred by the growing tension around them.
        As the weeks went by, strange things began to happen in the town. People reported hearing eerie noises in the night, like the sound of a train whistle blowing in the distance. Others claimed to have seen ghostly figures walking along the tracks of the ant railroad, disappearing into thin air as quickly as they had appeared.
        The townspeople became convinced that the ants were up to something sinister, and a group of brave volunteers decided to investigate. Armed with flashlights and determination, they set out to follow the railroad tracks into the dark woods beyond the town.
        What they found there was beyond anything they could have imagined. The ants had built a network of tunnels and caverns underground, connecting to a massive underground city filled with strange and terrifying creatures. The volunteers were horrified as they stumbled upon the true purpose of the ant railroad - to transport souls from the surface down
