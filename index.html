  <h3>       
       Web applications are software applications that run on remote servers and are delivered to the user’s device over the Internet. 
        <p> Web  applications differ from websites in that web sites generally display static information. A web app on the otherhand can help create a dynamic user experience by adding interactive elements. </p>
        interactive elements can include things like clickable buttons, text input fields. More sophsicated elements can even take user input from a mouse and even a controller.</p>
        >p> Web applications can be used for a wide variety of purposes, from simple websites that display information to complex applications that allow users to perform tasks such as online shopping, banking, and more. </p> 
        
        <p> It is important to note that websites may host web applications, but not all websites ARE web applications. </p>
        
        Web applications can be accessed through a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. 
        The browser connects to the web server, which hosts the web application, and retrieves the code. The code is then executed on the user’s device, allowing the user to interact with the application. 
        Web applications can be built using a variety of programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. 
        A defining characteristed is that Web apps interact with back-end databases to store and retrieve data.
        
        <p Use cases for web applications include:</p>
        <p> - E-commerce websites that allow users to shop online </p>
        <p>     - Social media platforms </p>
        <p>     - Online banking applications </p>
        <p>     - Online learning platforms such as CANVAS </p>
        <p>     - Collaboration tools </p>
        <p>     - Government websites that allow interaction with public data such as GIS mapping </p>
        <p>     - Entertainment platforms such as Netflix </p>

        <p> None of these use cases would be possible without the communicating with the back end databases to retreive and display updated information. </p>
