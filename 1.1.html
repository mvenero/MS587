     <u> MS 587 Assignment 1.1 : Introduction to  web applications </u> <br>

    <h3>
        
       Welcome to the internet of the 90's. I hope your People PC account is in good standing or you might have to use AOL. <br>
       This will eventually be a splash page that will link to each class assignment, but I don't know what I'm doing yet. <br>
       The first priority is to get some text and images on the screen and get a feel for it. I spent a lot of time getting
       GITHUB to work. I have zero tolerance for manipulating the files manually when there are tools out there. I simply do not have the time.
       but it was a rather steep learning curve. <br><br>
       
       There is an extremely basic CSS shell and some text and images on the screen. Everything needed to get started <br>

       I can now make changes and preview same in a local browser, then push to Github with ease.  
       The time spent on this worklow was worth it. <br>

        <u> What are web applications? </u>
    </h2>

    <h3>       

       Web applications are software applications that run on remote servers and are delivered to the user’s device over the Internet. 
        <p> Web sites generally display static information. A web app on the otherhand can help create a dynamic user experience by adding interactive elements. </p>
        interactive elements can include interactive elements such as buttons and input fields. More sophsicated elements can take user input from end user devices such as a mouse or game controller. The internet wasn't exactly designed with this in mind however.</p>
        Web applications can be used for a wide variety of purposes, from simple websites that display information to complex applications that allow users to perform tasks such as online shopping, banking, and more. </p> 
        
        <p> It is important to note that websites may host web applications, but not all websites ARE web applications. </p>
        
        Web applications can be accessed through a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. 
        The browser connects to the web server, which hosts the web application, and retrieves the code. The code is then executed on the user’s device, allowing the user to interact with the application. 
        Web applications can be built using a variety of programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. 
        A defining characteristed is that Web apps interact with back-end databases to store and retrieve data.
        
        <h2><p><u> Use cases for web applications include:</u></p> </h2>
        <h3> - E-commerce websites that allow users to shop online <br>
           - Social media platforms <br>
           - Online banking applications <br>
           - Online learning platforms such as CANVAS <br>
           - Collaboration tools <br>
           - Government websites that allow interaction with public data such as GIS mapping <br>
           - Entertainment platforms such as Netflix <br>
           - Intranet portal to access business or organizational resources <br>
           

        <p> None of these use cases would be possible without the communicating with the back end databases to retreive and display updated information. </p>
